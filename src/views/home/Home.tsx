        <p>
          The ASME UET Peshawar Chapter is a space where students from all
          backgrounds come together to learn, share ideas, and grow. As part of
          the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), we focus on
          hands-on learning, exciting projects, and opportunities to connect
          with like-minded peers. Whether youâ€™re into designing, coding,
          problem-solving, or just curious to try something new, this is the
          place for you. Join us to explore new possibilities, make friends, and
          create memories that last a lifetime!
